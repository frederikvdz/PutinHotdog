# PutinHotdog
Browser extension that changes images of President Putin to that of the 'we're all trying to find the guy who did this'-meme

# To install locally follow these steps:
- download the extension folder and unzip it

# For Firefox
Go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox

You'll see a 'Load Temporary Add-on' option, load the manifest.json file.

# For Chrome
Go to chrome://extensions.
Turn on Developer Mode and switch to it

Load the folder with the files in them here.

# Some notes
It relies on a correctly formated image with either an alt text or title. So it's not full proof. A figure with figcaption will also work. 
- css background images don't work (yet)
